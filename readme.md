### Handesk

## Description
Handesk has been created by our need (At Revo Systems www.revo.works) to have a powerful yet simple Ticketing system, we needed a system that allowed us to
have multiple teams, with multiple users, easy and efficient reporting by all/team/user as well as lead management.

[Landing page: http://handesk.io](http://handesk.io)

Check out the screenshots to see how nice it looks, and feel free to contribute by sending us PRs.
We will keep adding features as we need them, but our basic workflow is totally covered :D

## Features
· Email polling (new tickets and tickets updates)    
· Email attachments as ticket attachments (using laravel storage driver)
· API for creating/updating/fetching tickets/leads so you can display them into your main app    
· Instant email/slack notifications when tickets are created/updated   
· Everything is unlimited    
· Lead management (With its API as well)   
· Auto lead subscription to mailChimp based on its tags   
· Tickets reporting   
· Tickets internal notes   
· Tickets can be escalated, so assistants can comment on them to help the teams   
· Can merge tickets       
· Mention agents with @name so they get notified
· Lead tasks, that can have a due date, and sending daily tasks email   
· Create issues to your code repository directly from the ticket   
· Updating the ticket automatically when an issue is marked as resolved         
· UI multi language support (default en, alternative ca, de, fr, es)    
· Roadmap module, you can create ideas that come from your customers or your own, give them deadlines and integrate them with your repository manager,

## Installation
Its very simple, you just need to follow the standard Laravel installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BadChoice/handesk.git
cd handesk
composer install
# Setup your .env file to match you desired database
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link #if you use the local driver
```

Alternatively, you can use the following [docker setup](https://github.com/BadChoice/handesk/blob/dev/docker-installation.md)


> The default admin user is admin@handesk.io / admin
> If you want email pulling, you need to enable the `imap` extension on php (note that on mac the php-cli runs very slow, you need to update your /etc/hosts file 

```
::1         localhost YourMac.local
127.0.0.1   localhost YourMac.local
```

Open your `app/Console/Kernel.php` to update the schedulers as you want (comment them if not needed)
Add the cron job `* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`
